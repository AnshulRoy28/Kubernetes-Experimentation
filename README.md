## 📖 What is this?

This repo documents my personal journey learning **Kubernetes** from scratch. Instead of relying on managed cloud platforms, I'm running a **K3s cluster on a Raspberry Pi 4** to understand how container orchestration actually works under the hood.

Each week covers a new set of concepts, with real configs, screenshots, and notes from what I tried, broke, and learned.

## 🗂️ Structure

| Week | Topic | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [**Week 1**](Week%201%20Basics/) | **Basics** | Cluster setup, deployments, pods, services, NodePort, load balancing, and stress testing |
| Week 2 | *Coming soon* | — |

## 🛠️ Setup

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB RAM)
- **OS:** Raspberry Pi OS Lite
- **K8s Distribution:** [K3s](https://k3s.io/) — lightweight, production-ready Kubernetes
- **Network:** Local network cluster (`192.168.1.2`)

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand Kubernetes fundamentals by doing, not just reading
- Build muscle memory with `kubectl` commands
- Run real workloads on constrained hardware to see actual limits
- Document everything so others can follow along
